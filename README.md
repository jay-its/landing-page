Rent a Happy, Healthy Llama Today!

Tired of the same old petting zoo experience? Does staring at goats leave you feeling, well, goatally bored?  Then spice up your life with a LlamaLlama llama rental (not really)!

Here at LlamaLlama, we're not about forcing our llamas into uncomfortable situations (unlike those other llama rental companies -eww). Our llamas are organically raised, meticulously groomed, and ready to be the stars of your next event.

If you want to rent a llama, LlamaLlama is not real but this landing page is! I used HTML and CSS to create this page for the Odin Project. If you have any pointers on making it better, let me know!
